[Douglas Crockford](http://javascript.crockford.com/) has written some essential articles about javascript:

Here is a few of them:

*   [ Javascript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html)
*   [A survey of the Javascript programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html)
*   [Private Members in Javascript](http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html)
*   [Prototypal Inheritance in Javascript](http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html)
*   [Classical Inheritance in Javascript](http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html)
There are others on his javascript homepage and I strongly recommend all of them !
