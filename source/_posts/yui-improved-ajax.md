_"The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library is a set of utilities and controls, 		  written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications 		  using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX."_

I found [YUI ](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)very helpful for my applications. It's not the most complete framework that exists (look at [BackBase](http://www.backbase.com/) for example) but it is very promising. You can make new Components easily ( with YAHOO.util.Dom, YAHOO.util.Event ), ajaxified behaviour (with YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest ) etc...
I recommand two web sites :

*   [YUI Home Page (examples, good documentation and downloads)
](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/)
*   [Jack Slocum's Blog (<span class="blog-desc">Using the YUI library - Beyond the Examples)</span>](http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/index.php)
For WordPress users, you can even use YUI to for the [comments system](http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/2006/10/09/my-wordpress-comments-system-built-with-yahoo-ui-and-yahooext/).
