[![GitHub](http://github.com/images/modules/header/logo.png)](http://github.com/)

We [received](http://groups.google.com/group/inputex/browse_thread/thread/7b3c7c6fe63175cb) [queries](http://groups.google.com/group/inputex/browse_thread/thread/cdde227e520b63e2#) on the inputEx forum to switch our repository to [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)).

The YUI library [recently moved to GitHub](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2009/01/14/github/), so I decided to move both of the YUI-based libraries, inputEx and WireIt, to the same plateform.

Here are the two new repositories: [inputEx](http://github.com/neyric/inputex/tree/master "inputEx git repository") and [Wireit](http://github.com/neyric/wireit/tree/master "WireIt git repository").

The GitHub interface is friendly, it displays nice stats, has a cool API, and Git ! (But I'm missing a ticket system)

The good news is that it is really easy to import a SVN repository, and keeps the commit history.

See you on GitHub !

Ah... and Happy New Year !
