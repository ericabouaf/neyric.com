inputEx is an open-source javascript form library, built on top of the [Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/). It is still under development and will be released real soon, under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_license).

**Another Form Library ? **

Why would I create another form library, when we already have so many of them ?

I really like the way the YUI Library is built and I wanted a form library to be very close to the YUI philosophy. I believe the YUI library is really missing something: it has a lot of useful widgets, but you have to integrate them yourself within your forms, over and over again...

Have you ever created a web application or website without any input field ?

**Unobtrusive ?**

No !  I want the opposite. I hate HTML (although I'm still writing HTML every day for 10 years...). With inputEx, you describe your forms using [json](http://json.org/) !

**It's not all about validation **

Validation has been the main milestone for many form libraries. inputEx aims to tackle other issues, such as:

*   Form creation: each field will include its own configuration form. Thanks to a "type" field, we can then provide a form to create forms !

*   Extendability: form libraries always miss the field you need. A good form library should make it easy to create new fields easily. This pitfall has a unique solution: a good documentation !
Please be patient ! ;)
