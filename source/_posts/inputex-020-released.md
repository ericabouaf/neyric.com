[inputEx](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/) 0.2.0 is finally available for [download](http://code.google.com/p/inputex/downloads/list) !

This version of_ the YUI-based json form framework_ brings a great set of fixes and enhancements:

*   11 new fields
*   3 new widgets
*   25 enhancements on previous fields
*   cross-browser enhancements (IE 6 is on the way...)
I strongly suggest you take a look at the **[complete changeset](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/version.txt)**, and our **[new list of examples](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/doc/js_docs_out/examples.html)**.

Note: For those who were already using version 0.1.0, we wrote a [description of the json API changes between 0.1.0 and 0.2.0](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/doc/js_docs_out/migrate.html).

Finally, I would like to thank:

*   Maxime R. - _for his bug fixing !_
*   Daniel Barreiro (alias Satyam) - _for his help with YUI's style_
*   mingfai - _for his work on interactions and validations_
*   unomi - _for his ideas, bug reports and forum help_
*   [ClicRDV](http://www.clicrdv.com/) - _for open-sourcing this library_

Have fun !
