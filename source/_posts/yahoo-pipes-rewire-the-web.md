[**Yahoo! Pipes**](http://pipes.yahoo.com/ "Yahoo! Pipes") is an interactive feed aggregator and manipulator.

It is to web services, what the unix pipe  ( the '|' character) is to the command line.

With its nice visual editor, you can manipulate very easily multiple feeds, send them to other web services and so on...

The "source modules" are still quite limited. However, you can fetch any rss feed, which lets you import any kind of data you want.

Here are some links about the service itself:

*   [O'Reilly Radar article about this new service](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/02/pipes_and_filte.html)
*   [Techcrunch article](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/yahoo-launches-pipes/)
I almost forget to mention that Pipes offers output in RSS, RDF, JSON and Atom formats.

I won't say it is the killer app of Web 3.0 since it doesn't have any sens, but it's a big step towards the semantic web. I hope they'll soon implement Rdf sources or SPARQL queries.
