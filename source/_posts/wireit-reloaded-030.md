**WireIt is back !**

On June 19th, WireIt [was removed from distribution](http://javascript.neyric.com/blog/2008/06/19/wireit-removed-from-distribution/) for copyright infringements. After discussions with the Yahoo! User Interface and Yahoo! Pipes teams, a project started to provide the wiring widgets as a YUI module. (Note: I don't work for Yahoo! so it is NOT an official annoucment...)

I'm very happy with this decision and I can't wait having this integrated into YUI. However, the quality concerns of YUI requires very detailed attention to cross-browser support and YUI integration. It will take some time before it appears on the [YUI roadmap](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/roadmap/).

Meanwhile, I've been contacted by many WireIt users, who where anxious about using code with copyright infringements, and about seing no more bugfixes/new features. Therefore, I decided to release this new version that does not contain any coprighted code/assets anymore !

If you use WireIt &lt;= 0.2.1, you MUST upgrade to 0.3.0.

**WireIt get sponsored !**

Among WireIt users, [Tarpipe](http://tarpipe.com) decided [to sponsor the WireIt library](http://blog.tarpipe.com/2008/10/13/sponsoring-wireit/). I am grateful to them, for helping revive the project.

**What's new in version 0.3.0 ?**

*   Removed copyrighted images and code
*   New drawing methods (straight lines and arrows, thanks to Marcin Iwa?ski)
*   CanvasElement class (WireIt.Wire now inherits this class)
*   Scissors class (for the scissors widget)
*   LayerMap-beta (minimap to visualize/naviguate the layer)
*   [API Documentation](http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/doc/js_docs_out/index.html) much nicer and usable
*   WireIt.Layer: "clear" and "setWiring" methods
*   Bug fixes (including the much awaited positionning issue)
I also started an [interactive presentation](http://javascript.neyric.com/wireit/presentation.html), to demonstrate WireIt features.

Have fun !
