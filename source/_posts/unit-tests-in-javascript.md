If you're used to unit testing ( using JUnit in java, Test::Unit in Rails, etc... ), you might like to have a look at [http://www.jsunit.net/](http://www.jsunit.net/)

"It is essentially a port of         [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/) to JavaScript.  Also included is a platform for         automating the execution of tests on multiple browsers and mutiple machines running different OSs."
