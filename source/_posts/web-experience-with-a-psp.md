I tried to surf on the web with the PSP and a WiFi access (with a WEP security), here's how it looked like :
<div style="text-align: center">![Neyric.com on a PSP](http://www.neyric.com/images/neyric.com-psp.jpg)</div>
Nice isn't it ? The browser is quite good and has a "global overview" functionnality which makes the navigation easier.
However, don't think about entering informations (entering the url is already a challenge)...
