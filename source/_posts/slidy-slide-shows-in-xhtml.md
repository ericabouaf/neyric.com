One thing I discovered during the latest RIN workshop (thanks to [Anita de Waard](http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/anita/)) was [_**Slidy**_.](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/)

Slidy is a very handy way to create Slide Shows in XHTML and is, in my opinion, much more powerful than PowerPoint or even OpenOffice equivalent. I suggest you to see the [Slidy presentation](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy/) to see the result AND to learn how to use it (it REALLY is simple).
I also suggest you this presentation _["Web of Applications"](http://www.w3.org/2006/02/woa/)_ that contains further features available in Slidy.

Now make your slide shows very easily and present them on the web or on any browser. Have fun !
