We were so focused on developping very cool web applications with inputEx, that we delayed this released many times. [Here it is](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/) !

Beyond the usual bug fixes, we received very cool contributions:

*   [MapField](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/js/ext/MapField/map_field.html): Thanks to David Janes. It can handle MS Virtual Earth, Yahoo! Maps or Google Maps. It returns the latitude/longitude coordinates but also the zoom level.
*   [MenuField](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/examples/menu_field.html): Thanks to Maxime RÃ©ty. Useful solution using the YUI Menu widget instead of grouping dropdown menus.
*   Italian localization by alexodus. If you speak Spanish or German, it will take only a few minutes to translate and post it on the [forum](http://groups.google.com/group/inputex).
*   Json-schema referencing by Brad Clements. (see below)
Other things in this release :

*   [VectorField](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/js/ext/VectorField/vector_field.html). I use this one for storing positions or any kind of vectorial information.
*   [FileField-beta](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/examples/file_field.html). It only works if you're using a POST method to submit the form, but might be useful for you.
*   The [inputEx Builder](http://javascript.neyric.com/inputex/inputExBuilder/inputExBuilder.html) can now export the generated code to a page, and load a form from a inputEx Json definition or a json schema !
*   We also moved the repository to [GitHub](http://github.com/neyric/inputex/), although the wiki has not moved yet.
