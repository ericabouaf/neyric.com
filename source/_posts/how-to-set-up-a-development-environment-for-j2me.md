The first time I tried to build a J2ME (Java2 Mobile Edition) application, I had a hard time choosing the right tools.

Hereâ€™s a tiny guide to setup a development environment for J2ME (under Windows) :

*   Install a JVM (Java Virtual Machine). I used jre_1.5.0.09 from [http://java.sun.com/](http://java.sun.com)
*   Install Eclipse (I used version 3.1.2) from [http://www.eclipse.com/](http://www.eclipse.com/)
*   Install Nokia Prototype SDK from [http://www.forum.nokia.com/](http://www.forum.nokia.com/)
*   Install [EclipseME](http://www.eclipseme.org): Open eclipse and go to Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Software Updates-&gt;Find and Install -&gt; New remote site then enter in the address field http://eclipseme.org/updates

Nokia Prototype SDK is called a â€œWireless Toolkitâ€, and is only available under Windows.

If you run Linux, youâ€™ll have to choose another Wireless toolkit as â€œSun Wireless Toolkitâ€ ([Man google](http://tiboz.kikal.org/magic/Man_Google.png))
