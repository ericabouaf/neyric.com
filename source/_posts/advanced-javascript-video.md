Douglas Crockford from Yahoo! made a few presentations about the Javascript Language.

They are just awesome and I don't know how I was coding in Javascript before viewing them.

You can see them thanks to Yahoo! Videos, here are the links to the YUI-blog introducing them:

*   [The Javascript Programming Language](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/24/video-crockford-tjpl/)
*   [Advanced Javascript](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/27/video-crockford-advjs/)
The slides from the presentations are available on the same page to keep

important things in mind...
