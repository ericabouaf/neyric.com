[Dojo toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/), is well known in the Ajax community to provide numerous widgets to web developper.

Since version 0.4.1, it provides a way to store data on the client side trough dojo.storage.

It can use multiple ways to store those data, especially flash (which is present on 97% of the computers ).

Check out the Moxie demo application that combines the dojo rich text editor and the dojo.storage method.
