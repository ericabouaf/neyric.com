Here are some rules I constrain myself to, and that can be useful for others :

1.  [ Use good code conventions](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html)
2.  Check your code: JSLint (javascript tools bundle for textmate make it automatic)
3.  Minification of your code: [JSMin](http://javascript.crockford.com/jsmin.html)
4.  GZIP the code, don't obfuscate: [Minification v. Obfuscation](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/03/06/minification-v-obfuscation/)
You will effectively reduce errors and debugging time by following those advices.
