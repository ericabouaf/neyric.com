I just released the v0.2 of
[Gears In Motion](http://code.google.com/p/gearsinmotion/). The project has also migrated to Google Code so that anyone can checkout the SVN version. We also plan to use the "Issue Tracker" so feel free to add any bug/comment/feature request etc...

You can download [gim-standalone-0.2.zip](http://gearsinmotion.googlecode.com/files/gim-standalone-0.2.zip) and launch gim-standalone.html in **Firefox &gt;= 2**.

Here is a quick changeset (without the many bugfixes...):

*   Display GIM in a Panel (makes it easy to use in your own project)
*   Improved element liaisons visualization
*   SQL export is now displayed in a field so you can copy/paste it
*   Script that generate the standalone version
